# **Autonomous VIO-based Quadcopter**

Welcome to my Autonomous VIO-based Quadcopter project! This repository showcases the culmination of my efforts in integrating state estimation, trajectory planning, and control mechanisms for a quadcopter using Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO). The project aims to provide a seamless flight experience in a simulated environment.

## **Highlights**

- ***State Estimation***: The quadcopter is equipped to estimate its state in real-time, even amidst noisy sensor data.
- ***Trajectory Planning***: Advanced algorithms are in place to ensure the quadcopter plans its flight trajectory efficiently.
- ***Control Mechanism***: A robust control system is implemented to ensure the quadcopter adheres to the planned trajectory.
- ***Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO)***: The cornerstone of this project, VIO enables the quadcopter to function even in environments devoid of GPS.

## **Features**

- ***Simulator Implementation***: The simulator is designed to synthesize camera images based on the quadcopter's position, offering a lifelike flight experience.
